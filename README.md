Hey there, I'm Lucas Mendes and I'm an accountant turned tech enthusiast! 💻🚀

I'm currently working on a personal finance management app 📱💰 and studying React Native 🔍📚. In addition to React Native, I'm experienced in several programming languages, including Python 🐍, JavaScript 🕸️, TypeScript, Flutter, HTML, CSS, and even VBA for Excel macros 📊.

I have a knack for mobile app development 📱, web page creation 🌐, automation projects 🤖, project management 📈, data analysis 📊, and complex problem-solving 💡.

With my technical and business skills combined, I'm confident that I can take your company or project to the next level! 🚀
